# Titanic-Dataset-Prediction
Prediction of survived people from titanic dataset


Overview: This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic shipwreck using the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle1.

Data: The data consists of 891 rows and 12 columns, with information such as passenger class, sex, age, fare, cabin, embarked port, and survival status.

Analysis: The project involves data exploration, feature engineering, imputation, and model selection. The author uses various Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

Models: The author compares the performance of different machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors. The best model is the random forest classifier, which achieves an accuracy of 83.16% on the test data.
